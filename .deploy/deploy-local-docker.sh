# CHAP2 Local Docker Deployment Script
# This script builds and deploys the CHAP2 API and Web Portal using Docker for local development
# 
# What this does:
# - Builds and runs CHAP2 in Docker containers for local development
# - Uses Development environment settings
# - Runs on ports 8080 (API) and 8081 (Web Portal)
# - Includes hot-reload capabilities for development
# - Uses local data directory for persistence
