  "ChorusText": "And don\u2019t put a question mark where God puts a period.\nThe church is prayer conditioned.  When God ordains, He sustains\nSuffering from the truth decay?  Brush on your Bible\nBe ye fishers of men \u2013 you catch them and He\u2019ll clean them\nGive God what\u2019s right \u2013 not what\u2019s left.\nNothing else ruins the truth like stretching it.\nIn the sentence of life, the devil may be a comma-but never let him be the period\nWe don\u2019t change God\u2019s message \u2013 His message changes us\nMost people want to serve God, but only in an advisory position.\nGive satan an inch and he\u2019ll be a ruler\nHave a wonderfully blessed day!\nPlan ahead \u2013 It wasn\u2019t raining when Noah built the ark\nNever give the devil a ride \u2013 he will always want to drive\nHe who kneels before God , you can stand before anyone.\nDon\u2019t wait for six strong men to take you to church\nWorry is the darkroom in which negatives can develop\nA lot of kneeling will keep you in good standing\nExposure to the Son may prevent burning\nHe who angers you controls you\nRead the Bible \u2013 It will give you the knowledge that you need\nWhen praying, don\u2019t give God instructions \u2013 just report for duty\nExercise daily \u2013 walk with the Lord\nMan\u2019s way leads to a hopeless end \u2013 God\u2019s way leads to an endless hope\nAre you wrinkled with a burden? Come to the church for a face lift\nWARNING:\nCompassion is difficult to give away because it keeps coming back\nGod doesn\u2019t call the qualified, He qualifies the called.",
