  "ChorusText": "I\u2019ll bring you more than a song\nFor a song in itself\nIs not what you have required\nYou search much deeper within\nThrough the ways things appear\nYour looking into my heart\n2\n2 of 4\nWhen the music fades,\nand all is stripped away\nAnd I simply come,\nlonging just to bring\nSomething that\u2019s of worth,\nthat will bless your heart\n1\n1 of 4\nKing of endless worth\nNo one could express\nHow much You deserve\nThough I\u2019m weak and poor\nAll I have is Yours\nEvery single breath\n4\n4 of 4\nI\u2019m coming back to the heart of worship\nAnd its all about You\nAll about You, Jesus\nI\u2019m sorry Lord for the thing I\u2019ve made it\nWhen its all about You\nIts all about You\n3\n3 of 4",
