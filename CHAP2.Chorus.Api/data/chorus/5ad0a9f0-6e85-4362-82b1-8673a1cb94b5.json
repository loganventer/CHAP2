Some glad morning when this life is over, I\u2019ll fly away\nTo a land on God\u2019s celestial shore, I\u2019ll fly away.\nRefrain\nI\u2019ll fly away, oh glory, I\u2019ll fly away\nWhen I die, hallelujah by and by, I\u2019ll fly away.\n2. When the shadows of this life has grown, I\u2019ll fly away\nLike a bird from prison bars has flown, I\u2019ll fly away.\n3. Just a few more weary days and then, I\u2019ll fly away\nTo a land where joy shall never end, I\u2019ll fly away",
