  "chorusText": "Have a wonderfully blessed day!\nGive God what\u2019s right \u2013 not what\u2019s left.\nMan\u2019s way leads to a hopeless end \u2013 God\u2019s way leads to an endless hope\nA lot of kneeling will keep you in good standing\nHe who kneels before God , you can stand before anyone.\nIn the sentence of life, the devil may be a comma-but never let him be the period\nAnd don\u2019t put a question mark where God puts a period.\nAre you wrinkled with a burden? Come to the church for a face lift\nWhen praying, don\u2019t give God instructions \u2013 just report for duty\nDon\u2019t wait for six strong men to take you to church\nWe don\u2019t change God\u2019s message \u2013 His message changes us\nThe church is prayer conditioned.  When God ordains, He sustains\nWARNING:\nExposure to the Son may prevent burning\nPlan ahead \u2013 It wasn\u2019t raining when Noah built the ark\nMost people want to serve God, but only in an advisory position.\nSuffering from the truth decay?  Brush on your Bible\nExercise daily \u2013 walk with the Lord\nNever give the devil a ride \u2013 he will always want to drive\nNothing else ruins the truth like stretching it.\nCompassion is difficult to give away because it keeps coming back\nHe who angers you controls you\nWorry is the darkroom in which negatives can develop\nGive satan an inch and he\u2019ll be a ruler\nBe ye fishers of men \u2013 you catch them and He\u2019ll clean them\nGod doesn\u2019t call the qualified, He qualifies the called.\nRead the Bible \u2013 It will give you the knowledge that you need",
